# Data Analysis
## 1. Introduction

Give context... Explain rationale. Mention your initial question(s), etc. In order to find potential answers, I decided to use the [Street Food Vendors dataset](https://open.ottawa.ca/datasets/street-food-vendors/explore?location=45.390961%2C-75.706531%2C4.56) available on the City of Ottawa's open data portal.

This dataset includes...

## 2. Getting Data

### 2.1. Importation

I started by downloading the dataset from the City of Ottawa's open data portal. There were four options: CSV, KML, Shapefile, and GeoJSON. I decided to use the CSV file for the following reasons... (Explain them.)

I had to download the CSV file directly onto my computer, since there was no way for me to find the actual URL of the CSV file. Once that was done, I uploard the CSV into Google Sheets with "File" > "Import" > "Uploard." When prompted by Google Sheets, I left the selector type option as "Dected automatically."

This created a spreadsheet with X columns and Y rows. The columns include... describe the data and the data types...

NOTE: Students should try to use one of Google Sheets' five `IMPORT` functions. If you cannot do so (such as in this sample assignment), explain why and what you did instead.

If you do use an IMPORT function, make sure to include the code in this section of your assignment, such as `=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)`.

Alternatively, you can put your code in a box like this one:

``` r
=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)
```
